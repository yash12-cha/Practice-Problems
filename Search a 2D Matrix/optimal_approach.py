Algorithm / Intuition:
If we flatten the given 2D matrix to a 1D array, the 1D array will also be sorted. By utilizing binary search on this sorted 1D array to locate the 'target' element, we can further decrease the time complexity.

def searchMatrix(matrix, target):
    n = len(matrix)
    m = len(matrix[0])
    low = 0
    high = n * m - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        row = mid // m
        col = mid % m
        if matrix[row][col] == target:
            return True
        elif matrix[row][col] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return False

matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]]
target = 3
ans = searchMatrix(matrix, target)

'''
Time Complexity: O(log(NxM)), where N = given row number, M = given column number.
Reason: We are applying binary search on the imaginary 1D array of size NxM.

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
