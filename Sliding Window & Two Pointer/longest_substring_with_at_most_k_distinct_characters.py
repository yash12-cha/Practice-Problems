ðŸŽ¯ Complexity (Brute-Force)
Time: O(nÂ²) â€” two nested loops over n and O(1) operations inside.

Space: O(n) â€” in the worst case, freq can grow to store up to n unique elements.

Time Complexity: 
O(n), where n is the length of the string s. Each character is processed at most twice (once by the right pointer and once by the left pointer).

Space Complexity: 
O(k) for the dictionary that stores the count of distinct characters.
