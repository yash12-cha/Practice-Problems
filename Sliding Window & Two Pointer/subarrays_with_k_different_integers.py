'''
‚è± Time Complexity:
Each element is processed at most twice: once by the right pointer, and once by the left pointer during shrinking.

So the total time is O(n), where n = len(nums).

üíæ Space Complexity:
O(n) The space complexity depends on the dictionary count that stores the frequency of characters currently within the window.
