# Optimal Approach

'''
ðŸ§  Time Complexity:
O(n)
Each character is visited at most twice:

Once by the right pointer (when expanding the window)

Once by the left pointer (when removing duplicates)

So, total time is O(n) where n = len(s).

ðŸ’¾ Space Complexity:
O(k)
Where k is the size of the character set (in the worst case, all characters are unique):

For lowercase letters: O(26)

For ASCII: O(128)

For Unicode: O(number of unique characters)

The set stores at most k characters at a time â†’ O(k) extra space.
