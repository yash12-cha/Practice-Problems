ðŸ•’ Time Complexity

-> Outer Loop: Iterates through all possible eating speeds from 1 to max(piles). Let m = max(piles). This results in O(m) iterations.
->Inner Computation: For each speed k, the total_hours function computes the total hours needed by iterating over all n piles, leading to O(n) operations per iteration.
-> Overall Time Complexity: Combining both, the total time complexity is O(n * m).
This can be inefficient, especially when max(piles) is large.

ðŸ§  Space Complexity

-> Auxiliary Space: The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like low, high, result, and loop counters.
-> Overall Space Complexity: O(1) (excluding the input list piles).

    # Perform binary search on the range of speeds
    while low <= high:

            result = mid  # Update result to the current mid speed

ðŸ•’ Time Complexity

-> Binary Search Iterations: The binary search operates over the range of possible eating speeds, from 1 to max(piles). This results in O(log m) iterations, where m = max(piles).
-> Total Hours Calculation: For each candidate speed mid, the total_hours function computes the total hours needed by iterating over all n piles, leading to O(n) operations per iteration.
-> Overall Time Complexity: Combining both, the total time complexity is O(n * log m).
This is efficient and suitable for large datasets.
