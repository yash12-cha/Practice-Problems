'''
Time Complexity:
In the linear search approach, the algorithm examines each element in the matrix to determine if it's a peak.

Worst-case scenario: The algorithm checks every element in the matrix.

Time complexity: O(m √ó n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix.

This is because, in the worst case, the algorithm might need to inspect all elements to find a peak.

Space Complexity:
The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space:

Variables: Loop indices and a few temporary variables for comparisons.

No additional data structures: It doesn't utilize any extra data structures like stacks, queues, or auxiliary matrices.

Space complexity: O(1)

This means the algorithm's space usage doesn't grow with the size of the input matrix.

# Optimal Approach

        max_row = 0

'''
üîç Time Complexity: O(m √ó log n)
Where:

m = number of rows

n = number of columns

Breakdown:
The algorithm performs a binary search on columns, which takes O(log n) steps.

In each step, it scans the entire column to find the maximum element in that column, which takes O(m) time.

So total time = O(m) per step √ó O(log n) steps = O(m √ó log n)

üì¶ Space Complexity: O(1)
The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space (a few variables: low, high, mid_col, etc.).

No additional data structures like arrays or stacks are used.

Hence, space complexity = O(1)
