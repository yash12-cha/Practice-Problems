# Optimal Approach

from collections import deque

    n = len(arr)
    stack = deque()  # Will hold candidates for next greater
    ans = []

    # Traverse from rightmost to leftmost
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        # Remove any stack values â‰¤ current, they can't be next greater
        while stack and stack[-1] <= arr[i]:
            stack.pop()

        # If stack empty, no greater element to the right
        if not stack:
            ans.append(-1)
        else:
            # Top of stack is next greater element
            ans.append(stack[-1])

        # Push current for future comparisons
        stack.append(arr[i])

    # Reverse to match original order
    ans.reverse()
    return ans
