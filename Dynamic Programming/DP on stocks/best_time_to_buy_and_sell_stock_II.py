âœ… Time Complexity (TC):
The function solve(indx, prices, dp, buy) has two parameters that affect state:

indx: ranges from 0 to n-1 â†’ n possible values

buy: can be 0 or 1 â†’ 2 possible values

So, the number of unique states is n * 2 = 2n

Each state is computed once due to memoization (dp[indx][buy]), and each computation takes constant time (just a couple of max calls and recursive calls).

ðŸ‘‰ Total Time Complexity: O(n)

âœ… Space Complexity (SC):
There are two components to space:

DP Table:

dp is a 2D list of size n x 2

So, space = O(n)

Recursive Call Stack:

At most n recursive calls on the call stack (in the worst case, you go all the way to indx = n)

So, space = O(n)

ðŸ‘‰ Total Space Complexity: O(n)

'''
âœ… Time Complexity (TC):
Youâ€™re using a nested loop:

Outer loop: iterates i from n-1 to 0 â†’ n iterations

Inner loop: iterates over buy = 0 and 1 â†’ 2 iterations

Each cell dp[i][buy] is filled once with O(1) work.

ðŸ‘‰ Total Time Complexity: O(n * 2) = O(n)

âœ… Space Complexity (SC):
You're using a 2D DP table:

Size: dp[n+1][2] â†’ (n+1 rows for days, 2 columns for buy state)

ðŸ‘‰ Space Complexity: O(n * 2) = O(n)

Note: You can optimize space to O(2) (i.e., just two arrays curr[2] and next[2]) because the current day i only depends on i+1.

# Optimal Approach

def maxProfit(prices):
    n = len(prices)

    # next_day[0] = max profit if we must sell (we already hold stock)
    # next_day[1] = max profit if we can buy
    next_day = [0, 0]  # Initialized to base case (after the last day)

    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        curr_day = [0, 0]
        # If we can buy
        curr_day[1] = max(-prices[i] + next_day[0], next_day[1])
        # If we can sell
        curr_day[0] = max(prices[i] + next_day[1], next_day[0])
        # Move to previous day
        next_day = curr_day

    return next_day[1]  # Start at day 0 with the option to buy

ans = maxProfit(prices)

'''
âœ… Time Complexity (TC):
You are using a single loop:

A single for loop runs from day n-1 to 0 â†’ n iterations

In each iteration, you perform a few max and arithmetic operations â†’ O(1) time per iteration

ðŸ‘‰ Total Time Complexity: O(n)

âœ… Space Complexity (SC):
Instead of maintaining a full n x 2 DP table, you're only using:

next_day[2] and curr_day[2]: fixed-size arrays
