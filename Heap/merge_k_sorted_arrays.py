# Brute Force Approach

from typing import List

def mergeKSortedArrays(nums: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    combined = []

    # Manually append elements from each array to combined list
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(len(nums[i])):
            combined.append(nums[i][j])

    # Sort the combined array
    combined.sort()

    return combined

# Example usage:
nums = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
ans = mergeKSortedArrays(nums)

'''
Time Complexity:

Appending all elements: O(n) for total number of elements n
Sorting combined array: O(nlogn)
Overall: O(nlogn)

Space Complexity:

Uses O(n) space for the combined array.
