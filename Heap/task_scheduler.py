üïí Time Complexity (TC):
Let:

n = number of total tasks.

k = number of unique tasks.

T = total time units the scheduler runs (can be up to n + idle slots).

Step-by-step:
Building task_freq dictionary:
O(n)

Constructing and sorting max_list initially:

List creation: O(k)

Sorting: O(k log k)

Main loop runs for T time units:

In each unit:

Pop from front of max_list: O(1)

Append to cooldown_list: O(1)

When a task returns from cooldown:

Append to max_list: O(1)

Sort max_list again: O(k log k) worst-case (if all tasks still have non-zero frequency)

‚ö†Ô∏è Sorting max_list every time a task returns is expensive.

So if cooldown happens often, and k tasks are live frequently, worst-case sort can happen up to n times.

‚û§ Worst-case time complexity:
O(n + k log k + T √ó k log k)
But T can go up to 2n in worst-case (due to idles), so:

‚úÖ Final worst-case TC:
O(n √ó k log k)

üß† Space Complexity (SC):
task_freq dictionary ‚Üí O(k)

max_list (at most k entries) ‚Üí O(k)

cooldown_list (at most k entries at any time) ‚Üí O(k)

‚úÖ Final Space Complexity:
O(k)
